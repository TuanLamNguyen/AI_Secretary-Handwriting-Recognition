Title: "AI Secretary" Handwriting Recognition with Python

Introduction:
Handwritten character recognition is vital for applications in banking, postal services, and automation systems. This research aims to propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model to enhance the accuracy of handwritten character recognition, addressing challenges such as variations in writing styles and noise.

Methodology:
The proposed method uses CNNs to automatically learn discriminative features from raw input data, employing convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers to capture local and global patterns for accurate classification.
